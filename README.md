<h2>How to Install</h2>
<section>
   <b>1)</b> Locate your refind EFI directory. This is commonly "/boot/EFI/refind" though it will depend on where you mount your ESP and where rEFInd is installed.<br>
   <b>2)</b> Create a folder called "themes" inside it, if it doesn't already exist.<br>
   <b>3)</b> Clone this repository into the "themes" directory.<br>
   <b>4)</b> To enable the theme add "include themes/RefindPhoenix/theme.conf" at the end of "refind.conf".<br>
   <b>5)</b> You may need to change the default resolution of the rEFInd menu (see refind.conf).<br>
   <b>6)</b> The background can easily be replaced by any .png-file with a resolution of 1920x1080.<br>
